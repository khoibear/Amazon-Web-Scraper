Excellent dietary supplement
Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 21, 2023
So, I'm a year from turning 70 and, at a wide-shouldered 218 lbs., I hear people at the gym say about me, "That guy is jacked!"
This product is a major part of protein supplementation in my modified Ketoâ€”high-protein, high-fat, low carbohydrate, null sugar (and absolutely no machine oil [aka "vegetable oil"])â€”diet: one gram of protein per pound per day. Mixed with whole, organic milk, it is delicious, to the point that I have to ration my craving thirst for it. (It's also great mixed that way with added blueberries and/or diced strawberries!) You can also sprinkle a little cinnamon in, for a slightly different taste. (Add more liquid, if it's too thick.)
I've used multiple protein powders, meal replacement powders, etc., over the years and this is one of the best among all of them.
I feel sorry for those (in other reviews) who actually read, and believe, those California state warning labels. Remember that CA labels iodineâ€”a nutrient required for lifeâ€”as dangerous, causing cancer and/or birth defects. Those California labels are bovine excrement of the most repulsive kind.

This is great protein
Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on April 13, 2023
This is great protein that I've been ordering for a long time. Anyone here who says it's clumpy or doesn't mix well has never used a protein powder in their lives. This is a finely produced powder that mixes instantly. The Vanilla flavor is kinda nasty, but all the other ones are great.

Good Value!
Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on April 16, 2023
Great Value but the vanilla is a little potent for me. I like to add it to my Matcha Latte in the morning, the sweetness has allowed me to stop using any other sweeter in my drink but I would still choose a non flavored product next time.

Often I start dreading having to slam a new protein shake after a week or two. I have not had this reaction to this particular flavor and actually look forward to it as a treat. For calibration purposes, I primarily consume Naked Pea mixed with water. So my flavor bar might be a little low. Subjective, I know, but there ya go. Also, pay attention to the serving size (in grams) to protein ratio not the number of scoops when comparing cost with other products. It comes out to about the same as most.

Decent for the price, but not very chocolatey.

Itâ€™s hard to find a good protein powder that doesnâ€™t have unnecessary added ingredients. Itâ€™s also hard to find a good protein powder that doesnâ€™t have soy. I hate soy. Everyone should hate soy. Do some research.
I like that this is affordable, yet has very few ingredients, pretty much just protein and chocolate.
Which brings me to why I only give it 4 stars. Good price, decent ingredients, BUT the chocolate flavor is kind of bland. Itâ€™s like the difference between a good chocolate bar and one of those super cheap waxy type ones. Just not a lot of cocoa flavor. So I just add some nesquick powder or hot cocoa to it.
It mixes okay if you use a shaker bottle and let it sit for a few minutes or use a power mixer.
If they improved the chocolate taste I would give it 5 stars.

Great value.

For the price, this stuff is very good. Blends well and the flavour is fine; as a previous reviewer said, more butterscotch Dum-Dum than vanilla, but not offensive. I really like that there arenâ€™t a million weird ingredients in it, and doesnâ€™t seem to interfere with my digestive system at all. It annoys me that one level scoop of it is more like 35g than the 33g it says on the Nutrition Facts, but overall itâ€™s a solid product.

I bought this because I do not like flavored protein powders. This I great because I can mix it into my smoothies/shakes and it will not alter the taste. The flavor is not overwhelming and it mixes fairly well. Good value for money.

Smooth blending, tastes like a chocolate shake
Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 27, 2023
I add 3g of HMB to this when mixing. I have mixed it with milk (tastes just like a chocolate shake!) as well as water (not quite as shake like, but still tastes good and easy to drink). So far, this is the best tasting mix that I have used and is going to be part of my daily diet going forward.

Good flavorless protein powder at a reasonable price. The flavorless stuff has only two ingredients, whey protein and sunflower oil. No sucralose! Tastes like nothing, which means you can make it whatever flavor your pallet desires.

It's just the best, ok? You don't need any other reviews, just get the peanut butter chocolate. Tastes better than ANY other protein, period.
